                    Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin KBE (16 April 1889 â€“ 25 December 1977) was an English 
                    comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. 
                    He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, "The Tramp", and is
                    considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. 
                    His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a
                    year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy. 
                    Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for 
                    most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him
                    to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised 
                    by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. 
                    Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. 
                    He received an Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making 
                    motion pictures the art form of this century" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation 
                    for his work. He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City Lights,
                    Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked on lists of the greatest films of all time.
